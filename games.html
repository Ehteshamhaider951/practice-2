       Its a very problematic task for the owner of the bull to guide a bull. Because its a traditional game so many farmer of chakwal do
       their best work on his bull so that their bull perform well in the game.

    <p>Tent pegging (sometimes spelled tent-pegging or tentpegging) is a cavalry sport of ancient origin, and is one of only ten equestrian 
        disciplines officially recognised by the International Equestrian Federation. Used narrowly, the term refers to a specific mounted 
        game with ground targets. More broadly, it refers to the entire class of mounted cavalry games involving pointed and edged weapons 
        (lance and sword) on horseback, for which the term "equestrian skill-at-arms" is also used.</p></div>

       <div class="Paragraphs">
    
    <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on 
        offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, 
        and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored 
        for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game 
        if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle</p></div>
