 <p>CHAKWAL: Most people who travel the Lahore-Islamabad route, either on the M2 Motorway or along the G.T. Road, constantly complain of 
the costly and subpar food offered at various outlets located along the two main roads connecting the federal capital with central Punjab</p>
<p>But those who have discovered Shehryar Restaurant, located by Talagang Road just a few yards from Balkassar Interchange, don’t complain 
about this as much.</p>
<p>The restaurant’s building and the parking area look like they were built from the same local clay used to erect mud houses in its rural 
surroundings. The spacious and flowery gardens add to the eatery’s ambiance, where customers come from far and wide to sample their two 
trademark dishes: Rajasthani tikka and Shehryar’s famous ice cream.</p></div>

<h2>Shahryar Famous Rajasthani Tikka</h2>
<p>The Rajasthani tikka, once a favourite of the rajas of Rajasthan, is inevitably part of every customer’s order at the restaurant.
    Chaudhry Husnain, one of the restaurant’s owners, explained that Rajasthani tikka cannot be made from an entire chicken, because only two
    tikkas are made from one fowl.
    “The Rajasthani tikka only uses chicken drumsticks, and one thigh-cum-leg piece makes one tikka,” he said.</p>

<h3>RECIPE</h3>
<p>Once the marinade is ready, it is applied to the chicken, which is then marinated for six hours before being threaded onto skewers
     and grilled over coal with lashings of cooking oil. It takes about half an hour to cook a tikka and the chef ensures their tenderness.

    The smoky tikkas are then served with tamarind sauce, to complement its barbeque flavour. The tikkas are also accompanied by tandoori 
    bread, made from pure wheat flour using the traditional chakki method of grinding wheat, rather than the fine flour made by machines
     at flour mills.</p>
