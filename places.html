    <div class="Paragraphs"><p>
        Among Pakistan’s innumerable glories, is the Kallar Kahar Lake, located in Chakwal district of Punjab. Situated on the brink of M2 motorway, it is an easily accessible tourist attraction both from Lahore (224 km) and from Islamabad (156 km). It is famous for its natural gardens, dancing peacocks, spiritual sites and a salt water lake.
        
        If you want to watch dancing wild peacocks then you have to visit Kallar Kahar. You will have to get up early in morning - at least one hour before the sunrise - and have to go to the famous shrine of sufi saints Ahoo Bahoo (Syed Pir Muhammed Ishaq & Pir Muhammed Yaqoob) in Kallar Kahar. There you can watch dozens of Peacocks coming at shrine showing their gratitude and leaving before the visitors come. Peacocks rarely come at day time due to rush of visitors there. The spectacular wild peacocks come to shrine early morning and go back to jungle for the day time. From shrine you can watch the whole Kallar Kahar valley as it is on the top of hills. The town is in the valley and there is a beautiful salt water lake in front of the mountain.</p></div>
